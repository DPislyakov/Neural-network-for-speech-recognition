# Neural-network-for-speech-recognition
This project considers the creation of neural network models for speech recognition.
Two neural networks were built: simple NN and convolutional NN.


The data for the first NN were taken from the public domain. It contains the audio data of the speakers.

The data for CNN was taken from Kaggle. The set is called UrbanSound8k. The data were pre-processed.
